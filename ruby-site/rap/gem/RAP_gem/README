RAP

What needs to be done:
	- We are going to install a custom version of php in a custom path so it can't
	  mess with your system's normal php install.
	- Then we will do the gem install telling it where 
	- ...

Quick Setup:
	1. Run the configure script.
	   This will fetch php for you, compile it to a path you specify and create a
	   script to anounce the path to a shell.
			- In ruby-site/rap/lib/gem
				- ./configure [PHP install directory]
	
	2. Install RAP gem.
			- In ruby-site/rap/lib/gem/RAP_gem/pkg
				- RAP-x.x.x.gem -- --with-php-dir=[PHP install directory]
	
	3. Remove the pass through from your lighttpd.conf and change the ruby subdomain
	   to "www".
			
	4. Add the custom php path to your current shell.
	   (This will need to be done each time before you launch your server on a new
	   shell.)
			- In ruby-site/
				- run ". ./rap_path_setup"
				- or ". ./rap_path_setup && ruby nexopia.rb -c [you] [options]" will
				  configure the path and launch the server.
	
	5. Install apc and add it to your php.ini
	
	6. Launch your server normally.
	
	7. There is no step seven.
	

The Long Way:
	- get php source
