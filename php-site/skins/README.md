# Nexopia Skins Directory

The static-asset contents of this directory have been removed as they
are not being open-sourced.

The php files relevant to skins are left intact, and a sample skin
configuration file is also left intact in the `blue` directory. It
references files that do not exist in this incarnation of the 
repository though.
