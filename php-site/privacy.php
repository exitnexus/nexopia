Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our on line information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, you will find a link to it at the bottom of every page on Nexopia.com.


The Information We Collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Nexopia website (nexopia.com). On some pages, you can provide personal information to display to other users. It is important to us that you understand what information is displayed to the public and what is not. Of the information that is required to sign up, your username, age, sex and location are all publicly visible. You may choose to hide your Date of Birth however. It is used only to calculate your age. Your email will never be visible.

Any information you submit in your 'About Me', 'Likes' and 'Dislikes' sections of your Profile are publicly viewable to everyone (whether they are a registered member or not). If you submit details for MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) or ICQ, these are publicly viewable to all registered members.


The Way We Use Information:

The information you submit to the site is displayed on your profile and in some other areas of the site such as the Forums if you choose to use them. Please remember that any information shown on your Profile is viewable to anyone, not just registered members. To view your Profile as others will see it, please click the My Profile link in the top menu.


We use your email addresses to answer the email we receive, send out your activation details and send occasional Newsletters from time to time. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.


Our Commitment To Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on line.

It is your responsibility to protect your password, as it will allow anyone access to your account, including all of your sent and received messages. You should also take care to protect your email account, as anyone can request that your password is sent to your email address. If you lose control of your email account, someone can very easily get access to your Nexopia account.

To protect your Nexopia account, please ensure you do not use the 'Remember Me' feature or set your browser to remember your details on any public or shared computers.


Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 14, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 14.


How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect on line and maintain by viewing your Profile as the world sees it by click on the My Profile link in the top menu of any page. You can also email privacy@nexopia.com to request to see all the information will hold about you.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by logging into your account using your username and password and editing the information in question.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.


How To Contact Us

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please email us at privacy@nexopia.com and we will be happy to help.
