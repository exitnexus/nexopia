<b>"A User is using Fake Pictures"</b>

<p>


If you think this person is using pictures that are not them please take your accusations to the <a class=body href="http://www.nexopia.com/forumthreads.php?fid=39"><b>Fakers Forum</b> (Click Here)</a>. <b>YOU MUST HAVE PROOF</b>.

<p>
Create a new thread there posting links to the Profile of the "faker" and that of the real person or website from which they got the pictures as proof (indicating which user you think is fake if they are taking another users pictures) and the Mods in that forum will deal with the issue.
<p>
If the user is using pictures of you and you have not already done so, please make a picture of yourself (<b>a Sign Pic</b>) holding a piece of paper with your <b>Username and Nexopia</b> written by hand on it. Your whole face, and hand(s) holding the piece of paper must be visible. We use this to prove that you are you.

<b>Step 2: Reporting a User for being under 14</b>

</font>

<p>

<b>"A User is under 14 years of age"</b>

<p>

To use Nexopia, user's must be 14 years old or older.
<br>
Before we can do anything about a User that you suspect is under 14, we <b>must have proof</b>. The only forms of proof we accept is the User admitting their age either on their <b>Profile</b> or in someone's <b>Comments</b>.

<br>
Just knowing someone is under 14 is not enough proof - if we were to delete everyone who anyone claims is under 14, anyone could have anyone else deleted.

<p>
If you have <b>proof</b>, please use the form below to report someone for being under 14:

<p>

<b>Username of person who is under 14:</b>
<br><input class=body type=text name="subject" value="username goes here" style="width:300">

<br>

<b>Please give details of where the User admits to being under 14:</b>

<b>Step 2: Read our advice</b>
</font>

<p>

<b>"A User has "hacked" in to my account"</b>
<p>

There is <b>No Way</b> to "hack" in to someone's Nexopia Account. The <b>only way</b> to get in is with the <b>password</b>.


<p>
<br>

<b>If you feel someone has gained access to your Account, follow these steps:</b>
<li> Change your <b>Nexopia password</b> (make it something random - not your name, date of birth, phone number, etc)

<li> Change the password to your <b>Email Account</b> - it's possible someone knows that

<p>

<b>If someone has control of your account and has changed your password:</b>
<li> If they haven't changed the email address on the Account, go to the <a class=body href="http://www.nexopia.com/login.php">Login page (Click Here)</a> and click the <b>Lost Password</b> button.

<li> Enter your Username in the first box and press <b>Resend Activation</b>
<li> Check your email. If you do not get an email within 15 minutes, the Email Address has probably been changed on the account. See below
<li> If you get an email, go back to the Login Page and fill in the second part of the page, <b>Your Username:</b>, <b>Your Activation Key:</b>, <b>New Password:</b> and <b>Retype New Password:</b> and press <b>Change Password.</b>.


<li> Be sure to choose a <b>NEW</b> password that know one knows
<li> Change the password to your <b>Email Account</b> - it's possible someone knows that

<p>

<b>If someone has control of your account and has already changed the email address:</b>
<br>
Sorry, you have lost the account - you will need to make a new one. The only way they could have got into your account was with the password
<br>

Once you have made a new account, make a Sign Pic and report the other account as Fake <a class=body href="#fakepictures">(see the Fake Pictures section above - Click Here)</a>
